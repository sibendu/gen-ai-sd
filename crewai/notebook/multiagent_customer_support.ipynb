      "I understand you are looking to add memory to your Crew, which is a key step in ensuring that your team has the computational resources it needs to operate effectively. Unfortunately, due to an unexpected technical difficulty with our documentation access tool, I am currently unable to retrieve the specific steps from our official guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I am committed to providing you with the best support possible. To move forward effectively, I can offer the following suggestions:\n",

      "1. Please check if there is a settings or configuration section within the crewAI platform where resource allocation such as memory can be adjusted. This is commonly found in the 'Settings' or 'Administration' section of such platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. There may also be documentation available directly within the crewAI application, often accessible through a 'Help' or 'Support' section, which could provide detailed instructions on modifying your Crew’s memory allowance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If these options do not yield a solution, I highly recommend getting in touch with one of our technical specialists who can guide you through the process step by step. You can contact them through our official support channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, I will also continue to seek a resolution to the documentation access issue and will follow up with you as soon as I have an update. We appreciate your understanding and patience and are dedicated to ensuring your experience with crewAI is seamless and productive.\n",
