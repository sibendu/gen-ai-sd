Unfortunately, due to an unexpected technical difficulty with our documentation access tool, I am currently unable to retrieve the specific steps from our official guide.\n",

      "2. There may also be documentation available directly within the crewAI application, often accessible through a 'Help' or 'Support' section, which could provide detailed instructions on modifying your Crew‚Äôs memory allowance.\n",

      "3. If these options do not yield a solution, I highly recommend getting in touch with one of our technical specialists who can guide you through the process step by step. You can contact them through our official support channels.\n",
